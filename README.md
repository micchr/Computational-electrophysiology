# Electrophysiological-activity

This project shows the highlights the algorithm allowed, when applied to the vestibular hyperpolarization activated ionic currents known to consist of two components.

The algorithm revealed the presence of a high-voltage-activated slow component and a low-voltage-activated fast component. Moreover, the electrophysiological significance of these two Ih components was tested individually in computational vestibular ganglion neuron models (sustained and transient), in the control case and in the presence of cAMP, an intracellular cyclic nucleotide that modulates HCN channel activity.

The results suggest that, first, the fast and slow components modulate differently the action potential excitability and the excitatory postsynaptic potentials in both sustained and transient vestibular neurons and, second, the fast and slow components, in the control case, provide different information about characteristics of the stimulation and this information is significantly modified after modulation by cAMP.
